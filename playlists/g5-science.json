        "text": "Brain is the decision maker of our body. It controls all the movements of the body. It is responsible for human intelligence, memory and imagination. \n Brain is the most important organ for us. That is why, we should wear a helmet when you ride a two wheeler. \n # Structure of the Human brain. \n The brain is kept in a bony case called Skull. Skull is made up of eight immovable bones. The brain is protected by three membranes called menings. The brain is made up of tiny nerve cells called neurons. The brain is the centre of the nervous system. \n The brain is made up of three parts. \n 1. Cerebrum \n 2. Cerebellum \n 3. Medulla oblongata \n # Cerebrum \n 1. It is the largest part of the brain. \n 2. It is responsible for our memory. \n 3. We are able to learn languages, understand signs and symbols with the help of cerebrum. \n 4. The right side of the Cerebrum controls the left side of our body and vice versa. \n 5. Cerebrum is responsible for intelligence, imagination and reasoning. \n # Cerebellum \n 1. It co-ordinates the movements of the muscles of our body. \n 2. It helps to maintain the balance of the body. \n # Medulla oblongata \n 1. It is also called the brain stem. \n 2. It controls the breathing, heart beat and other involuntary muscles. \n 3. It connects the brain to the spinal cord."

The caves protected them from wild animals, air, sun, rain and cold weather. \n # Igloo \n Igloos are snow houses that can be found in Arctic parts. Here the temperate remains below -40 deg C throughout the year. Igloos look like a shell of tortoise. \n # Bamboo houses \n This type of houses are mainly found in earthquake prone places. They are mainly found in Indonesia, Japan and Andaman Islands. People will not get injured during earthquake due to the light weight of these houses. \n # Tents \n They are temporary houses. They are built using cloth, ropes and nylon. The soldiers, scouts, NCC students make these type of houses for their stay during camps. They are also called mobile houses. \n # Tree house \n These houses are built by the people in jungles to protect them from wild animals. They are built on trees. A platform is first constructed on the tree at the required height. The trunk of the tree itself becomes the pillar for the platform. The light-weight wood is used for building the rest of the house. A ladder is used to enter the house. During the night, the ladder is removed to protect from animals. \n # Apartment \n Many families can reside together in this type of houses. These are concrete houses with many floors.  They are built on strong foundation. Pillars are raised from the foundation and the building will stand on the strength of pillars. This type of houses are usually found in cities where there is large population and less space. Some buildings have too many floors and they are called skyscrapers. The look as if they are touching the sky. \n The tallest building in the world is in Dubai and it is known as Burj khalifa.  The height of this building is 828 meters. It has got 160 floors. "

Satellites are send to space and put it on an orbit with the help of rockets. \n Man-made satellites helps us in many ways. \n 1. Satellites help in predicting weather. We get forecast about rains and storms because of them. \n 2. They guide us in transportation. They take photos of Earth from high distance and help us in preparing maps. \n 3. They are helpful in information and communciation technology. \n 4. They are helpful in studying the resources in ocean. \n In India, ISRO is responsible for sending rockets and satellites to space. ISRO stands for Indian Space Research Organization. Usually rockets are launched from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh. \n There are some man-made satellites, in which human beings live, to conduct scientific experiments. They are called space stations. Life in space station is very different from Earth, because there is no gravity in space. So people will keep floating in the space."
