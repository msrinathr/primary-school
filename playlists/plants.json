        "text": "Plants are an important part of nature. Plants need good soil, water and sunlight. The main parts of the plant are root, stem, leaf, flower, vegetable and fruit. Plants gives us food, fresh air, medicine, wood etc.\n\nLEAF\nLeaf is usually green in colour. Leaves are of different shapes and sizes. Leaves have a life cycle on its own. A new leaf would be soft and small. It grows in size. And finally it will dry and fall to the ground. Leaves are food to animals like goat, cow and deer. We too eat some of the leaves. Though they are not tasty, they are healthy. \n\nFLOWER\nMany kids feel that flowers are the most attractive part of a plant. Flowers are of different shapes and colours. Some flowers smell nicely. We can see butterflies and bees sitting on flowers and drinking honey. \n\nVEGETABLE & FRUIT\nIn most of the plants, flowers become vegetables and fruits. They provide food to humans like us, and they are very healthy. \n\nSEEDS\n Seeds are very important to plant, because they help in bringing new plants. Farmers sow to seeds to grow plants. Birds eat the fruits and throw the seeds in some other places. And after few days, a new plant will come from the seeds.\n\nSTEM\nStem is the strongest part of a plant. It helps the plant to stand straight. Plants with week stems are usually creepers. They need support to grow.\n\nROOT\nRoot is responsible for absorbing water and other minerals from the soil. The strength of the plant depends on the strength of the roots. Plants will week roots fell during rain and heavy winds."
