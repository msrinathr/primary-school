India is the largest democratic country in the world. \n  At country level, we select our Member of Parliament (MP), who goes to Parliament present in New Delhi to represent us. The selected MPs again vote among themselves and elect the Prime Minister. And the elected Prime Minister will pick other ministers. \n Though the President is considered as the head of the government, Prime Minister is the most important person in running the government. \n At state level, the people vote for their Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA), who goes to the Assembly present in their state capital to represent them. Just like how MPs select the Prime Minister of the country, MLAs select the Cheif Minister of the state. \n We also have Local Body election to select our representative at locality level.

        "text": "Plants and trees that grows naturally in a region of land is known as vegetation. Forests are large area of land, covered by naturally grown plants and trees. \n Vegetation in India is not uniform. Climate, soil and rainfall influence the growth of plants. \n Indian forests are broadly classified into five types. They are \n 1. Evergreen Forests \n 2. Monsoon Forests \n 3. Mangrove Forests \n 4. Thorn Forests \n 5. Himalayan Forests \n # Evergreen Forests \n These forests are found in the areas of the Western Ghats, the eastern parts of Himalayas and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. These forests get lots of rain. Bamboo, Rosewood and Sandalwood are common trees here. \n # Monsoon Forests\n Peninsular India and the northern parts of India are covered by monsoon forests. These forests get moderate rains. The trees shed their leaves during summer because of less rainfall. \n # Mangrove Forests \n These are seen in the Indian coastal line, in the Ganga delta and Brahmaputra region, in some backwater areas and salt marshes.  The roots of the trees of most forests are found usually under the ground. But salt water trees like Avicennia, have aerial roots which are above the water in  order to survive in the salt water. These prevent soil erosion  and prevent fertile soil from being washed away into the ocean. \n # Thorn Forests \n They are found in the areas which receive less than 50 cm rainfall. Parts of the Deccan Plateau and Rajasthan have thorny trees like Acacia, Babul and Palmyra.\n # Himalayan Forests \n You can find trees like  Pine, Cedar, Oak,  Walnut and Apple. We can also see some on these trees in Nilgiris and Kodi Hills."

The activity of extracting minerals from earth is known as mining. \n Minerals are of two kinds, namely metallic and non-metalic. Iron, copper and gold are the important metallic minerals. Petroleum and coal are the important non-metalic minerals. \n India is rich in mineral wealth. Iron ore are present in large quantity and India is a major exporter of Iron. It is used in industries, and making machine parts. \n Aluminium is light-weight in nature, and it is extracted from Bauxite ore. Aluminium is used in making aircraft, vessels, etc. \n Copper was the first  metal used by human beings. It is widely used in electrical equipments. \n Coal is primarily used as fuel and also used in generating electricity. \n Petroleum is a natural resource. The by-products of petroleum are petrol, diesel and kerosene. They are mainly used as fuel and generating energy. In India petroleum is found under sea near Mumbai. But we majorly import petroleum from other countries. \n Indians love gold ornaments and objects made of gold. India majorly imports gold. \n # Conserving our minerals \n Our minerals are being consumed so rapidly that there is a danger of their running out. We must save them and use them wisely. \n Alternate sources of energy and fuel are being considered.  Chief among them are solar and wind energy. This aims at conserving the available mineral resources from being rapidly depleted. "

I refer my farmer as my master. \n I was born in a small village in Gujarat. Each year, my master kept aside some seeds from a good crop. That way our bajra family went on from one generation to another. Good seeds were stored in dried gourd coated with mud. Later, my master made a strong wooden box to store us. He put in neem leaves to protect us from insects. This was how I ended up in this wooden box. \n Over the years, many changes took place in the village. Some places could get water from the canal. They said the canal brought water from far away – where a dam had been built on a big river. Then electricity came. Switch on the button and there was light! People found that only one or two crops, like wheat and cotton, got better prices in the market. So most farmers began to grow only these. So my master never used me on field. \n My master got old and his son took over the farming activity. He used an electric motor to pump water from ground. He also bought a tractor to plough the field. The tractor could do in a day, what the bullocks would take many days to do. Master's son made good money. \n After twenty years, again there were many changes. Without cows and baffaloes, there was no cow dung, to be used in the fields as fertilizer. So the son bought expensive fertilizer. The new seeds were easily affected by harmful insects. Pesticides had to be sprayed on the crops to keep away the insects. To meet all these expenses, loans had to be taken from the bank.\n Due to pumping, the ground water also depleted. Whatever little profit was made, was used to repay the loan. \n And today is my last day. My master's family is selling the old things which they consider as useless. They are going to dispose me of my home. The seed box is going to be used as a toolbox for keeping mechanical tools, screws, nuts and bolts."

Mother keeps all green vegetables and tomato in fridge, so that they are good for some time. But she keeps onion and potato in open space as open air helps them to be good for some time. \n Mother makes pickle from mango and lemon which we can have with food for a couple of months.
